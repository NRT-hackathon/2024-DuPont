This project is done as a part of the course CHEG848/ELEG848/CISC848: Computing and Data Science for Soft Materials Innovation. The two tasks of this project are Molecular Property Prediction (SMILES to HOMO/LUMO properties), Molecule Optimization (SMILES --(Change of Properties (HOMO,LUMO)--> SMILES).
We used RoBERTa architecture for property prediction and finetuned Llama-2-7B-Chat model for molecule optimization based on our custom prompt dataset prepared using similarity SMILES concept.
