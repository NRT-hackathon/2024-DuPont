For molecule optimization, Since modifying SMILES and calculating HOMO/LUMO properties is computationally intensive, to get one of optimized SMILES for our SMILES in datset we paired most similar SMILES calculating tanimoto coefficient(Jaccard Index). We generated prompts based on ranges of HOMO, LUMO values. We finetuned Llama-2-7B-Chat model on these custom prompt dataset, those who ere interested in either prompt dataset  or QLoRA adapters can found in hugging face repo:SriVishnuAkepati/llama-2-7b-finetuned-v2.
